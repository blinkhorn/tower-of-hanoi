## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named variables, though contained some few style / quality issues (commented out code, diverse approaches) that stemmed from experimentation. Added challenge with adding a library

## Creativity and Interface
